        The first time Austin had his entrepreneurial mindset was at 16 years
        old, he was going to the gym very frequently at that time and got
        results very fast with the knowledge and routines he was doing and
        others wanted to do the same so he decided to make meal and workout
        plans for people, and charge them $25 for one or $ for both and it was a
        hit. He then was getting ready for senior year of highschool and met his
        now fiance. The month he graduated he decided to open up his first real
        business which was a pressure washing business named Like A Pro Pressure
        Washing LLC and learned many new skills on the business side of things
        very quickly, the most important skill learned from that business was
        the marketing, like door to door sales and face to face building rapport
        and negotiating with clients, really helped build further new important
        relationships.

        While business was booming it was labor work and 8-12 hours a day, he
        wanted to find something that could make the same money or more but less
        intensive, Work Smarter Not Harder is what he was always told. He found
        a post online talking about stock trading and began studying the markets
        any chance he got. He began starting to make some small profits here and
        there, everyday he got better and the profits slowly increased and the
        trading only took place for roughly 1 hour a day. He then decided he had
        enough money saved and the income from stocks was increasing slowly that
        he sold his pressure washing business and started trading stocks. As the
        the profits increased he decided to post the results on social media,
        other people became very interested from making X amount of dollars from
        home or anywhere in just about an hour and they were hooked as well.
        Austin decided to start his next business venture of creating a course
        about how to trade self sufficiently in the stock market, and pass along
        the knowledge he had to profit like he was. The course became very
        popular with selling 10 on the first day of release. After the students
        were diving into the course they still wanted to take the same trades as
        Austin so the next feature of the business he decided to add was a
        chatroom with daily news, price points he thought stocks would start
        mvoing at and also discussion of hot stocks to keep an eye on throughout
        the week. Along with that direct help to answer questions regarding the
        course or questions about the markets in general.

        Austin started to want to learn code while he was trading stocks, he
        realized that you can build a automatic trading robot using code and
        wanted to learn ever since. He decided to take the leap and join a 3
        month immersive coding bootcamp.
